# Running the labs

## Here's the software stack I use:
* [Python >=3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)
* [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installing

First, make sure you have the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/bathcat/python_foundations
  cd python_foundations/labs

That's it! There aren't any external dependencies, so you won't need `venv` or `pip`.



### Test it out:
```
py .\src\A.0.HelloPython\complete\main.py
```
