# Python Foundations


## Overview
The Introduction to Python training course is designed to demonstrate the Python programming language. The course begins by examining why to adopt Python, where Python excels, and how it compares to other programming languages. Next, it transitions into a nuts-and-bolts examination of key language features, concepts, and functionalities. The course concludes by analyzing how to apply OO programming concepts with Python, work with exceptions, and create modularity in your applications.


### Duration 
2 Days


## Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
* Install and configure a development environment to support Python
* Create a basic stand-alone Python application
* Perform basic text-processing functionality using Python
* Develop a modular application



## Tech Setup
At a minimum you just need: 
1. A recent(ish) version of Python 3 
2. Your favorite text editor


However, the tools below are very nice to have:
* [Python >=3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)




## Outline

### Big Picture
* Good things about Python
* How Python is different
* Python Ecosystem
  * Jupyter
  * IDEs
  * Big Data-- Bricks & Spark

### Expressions & Primitives
* Getting Started with Python–The Basics
* Variables/Typing
* Basic types: int, float, string
* Built-in Python functions
* Python arithmetic
* Code Blocks/Colons
* Control structures
  - if/elif/else
  - Loops – for, while, range operator, the in operator
* Programming Pythonically

### Containers
* Iterables/Sequences/More
* Slicing operator
* Lists
  - join() / split()
  - sort() vs. sorted()
  - enumerate()
  - zip()
* List comprehensions
* Tuples
* Dictionaries
* Dictionary comprehensions
* Sets
* File I/O (stdin, stdout)

### Functions
* Positional arguments
* Default arguments
* Keyword arguments
* arg vs. kwargs

### Exceptions
* What is an exception?
* Error types: index, name, type, syntax, value, etc
* LBYL vs. EAFP
* try/except, else, finally

### Objects
* OO concepts supported by Python
* Creating classes, properties, methods, attributes, etc
* Applying encapsulation using method access, visibility, and conventions
