# Lab: List Golf

## Summary 

You're working on an existing application
that was built-- for the most part-- by 
drunk children. They have written some very
naive list functions and the unit tests are
failing. 

Your job is to fix the functions in the
**list_tools.py** module so the tests pass.

## Details 
* Run **main.py** to execute tests

## Requirements   
1. Tests pass

## Stretch Goals
1. Make it pythonic
