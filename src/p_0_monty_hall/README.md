# Lab: Monty Hall

## Summary
The Monty Hall problem is classical example of how our
mathmatical intuition isn't always right.

Here's the description from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)
> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given 
> the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; 
> behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, 
> and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens 
> another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says 
> to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your 
> advantage to switch your choice?

Most people have the sense it doesn't matter if you 
switch or not. It seems like a coin-flip: 2 closed doors,
so the chances are 50% with either one.

Using Python, we can run a simulation-- or many simulations--
of the game to get the actual answer.
