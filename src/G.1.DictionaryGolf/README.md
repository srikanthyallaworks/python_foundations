## Summary 

Your local elementary school heard that you "know computers." 
Now they're asking for your help in writing some reports
about the student body.

They already have a student roster in a Python data structure 
that looks like this:

```python
roster=[
  {"givenName":"Leroy", "surname":"Silva", "grade":4},
  {"givenName":"Lynn", "surname":"Guerrero", "grade":2},
  {"givenName":"Mary", "surname":"Short", "grade":2},
  # ...
]
```


## Requirements   
Write the following reports:

1. Class size by grade. Something like:

> Here are the students in each grade:
>        1: 12
>        2: 19
>        3: 33
>        4: 2
>        5: 90

2. Common surnames-- anything appearing more than 3 times. Like:

> Here are some common surnames:
>        Doe: 13
>        Bloggs: 3


## Stretch Goals
1. Sort your output by frequency / grade
2. Include only the 3 most common names
3. Find the 3 most common given names















## Hints
* Read the documentation on [sequence types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range).
