# Hello Python

## Summary
This is a really simple terminal-based guessing game. You can crack out
from scratch if you really want. For now though it's a good high-level
picture of what a Python script looks like.


## Details

The Federal Department of Fun has invented a new game. It's 
easy to play, an no one ever loses. 

Game play:
  1. Prompt the user to think of a number between 1 and 100.
  2. Take a guess
     - **If the guess is correct**, the game is over. **Everyone  wins!**
     - **If the guess is incorrect**, get input from the user indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. Then take another guess.


## Product Requirements
* Run the completed project 
* Walk through the source code


## Stretch Goals
* Implement the game yourself














## Hints
* Prompt for a text response with [`input`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input)
