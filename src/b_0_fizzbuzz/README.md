# Lab: Fizz Buzz - Text Edition

## Summary: 

Surprisingly, lots of professional programmers can't really 
code[1]. FizzBuzz is a classic interview question for sussing-out 
the non-skilled. 
                  
Here it is:
* Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
* But--
  - For multiples of 3 print “Fizz” instead of the number 
  - For the multiples of 5 print “Buzz”. 
  - For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print “FizzBuzz”.

Your output should look like this:
> 1  
> 2  
> fizz  
> 4  
> buzz  
> ...  


## Requirements
1. Implement `toText` method
2. Write the correct output--described above-- to the console

## Stretch Goals
* Write unit tests to document and test.

## Hints
* Check out the built-in function [range](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range).
* To check divisibility, look into the operator [modulo](https://realpython.com/python-modulo-operator/)
* For unit tests, here's a reference on the built-in framework [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
