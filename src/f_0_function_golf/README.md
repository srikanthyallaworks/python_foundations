# Lab: Function Golf

## Summary 

You're working on an existing application
that was built-- for the most part-- by 
drunk children. They have written some very
naive functions and the unit tests are
failing. 

Your job is to fix the functions in the
**function_tools.py** module so the tests pass.

## Details 
* Run main.py to execute tests

## Requirements   
1. Tests pass

## Stretch Goals
1. Make it pythonic
















## Hints
* Read the documentation on [sequence types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range).
