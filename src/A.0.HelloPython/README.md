# Hello Python

## Summary
This is a really simple terminal-based guessing game. You can crack out
from scratch if you really want. For now though it's a good high-level
picture of what a Python script looks like.

## Details

The Federal Department of Fun has invented a new game. It's 
easy to play, an no one ever loses. 

Game play:
  1. Prompt the user to think of a number between 1 and 100.
  2. Take a guess.
     - For a correct guess, the game is over.
     - For an incorrect guess, the user will give you a clue: either
       too high or too low
     - Repeat 


## Product Requirements
* Run the completed project 
* Walk through the source code


## Stretch Goals
* Implement the game yourself
