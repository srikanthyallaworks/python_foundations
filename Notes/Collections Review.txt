Review:
  1. These are 3 reasons to choose python
       Everywhere
       Lots of developers
       Batteries
       Low-ceremony

  6. Benevolent Dicator for Life
  	 Guido

  7. The philosophy of having a rich and versatile standard library
     Batteries included

  2. Everything in Python is an _____
     Object - No real primitives

  3. A function's default return value
  	 None - Like null or nil

  4. The 2 loop constructs
     _for_ & while

  5. The 2 ways to exit a loop early
     return, break

     continue takes you to the beginning of the next iteration


  8. These are 3 'falsy' things
     False, None, 0, '', [] 



Collections review:

1. When to use a list
   Store ordered collection of items. Homogenous 

2. When to use a dictionary
   Key / value pair
   * Don't know the keys in advance
   * Or the key is non-text
		employee = {
			'id':123,
			'name':'xiz'
		}   

		birthyears = {
			1899:['james'],
			1982:['xiz','shelby'],
		}   

3. When to use a tuple
    Immutable
    Multi return values

      def try_get_record(id):
         # mail
         return was_succes, value


4. Use sets for:
    Quick lookup
    Remove duplicates
    Unordered
    Can use 'in' operator
